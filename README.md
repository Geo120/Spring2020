<h2>Geo120: Maps & Mapping</h2>


<p>Tuesdays 3:30-4:50 	 Hybrid: UBLearns & Wilkeson 145	

<h3>Welcome!</h3>


Maps, technology and teaching are three of my favorite things and I’m looking forward to sharing them with you this semester. This class is a hybrid course as there are no classroom-based lectures and content is delivered through videos and assessments on UBLearns, but we will meet weekly in the GIAL (pronounced like “jail”) for engagement activities and lab-workshops. Our class meetings are essential to developing the skills to move forward in the class and the field. If you have any questions about course content or assignments, please remember we are here to help. Reach out to me or to our TA, Yujia, so we can support your success. This course is synchronous, which means the community of your peers are all focused on the same content at the same time and can be a resource for you. Lastly, this course requires more independence, self-discipline, and time-management skills than a traditional classroom experience, and it might not be the right fit for everybody.

Please read and think about the policies contained in this syllabus and then take the syllabus quiz on UBLearns to show that you understand.  This syllabus is my agreement with you as to what you need to contribute to earn a grade and what you will gain from your efforts.  

Let’s make this a great semester!

-Dr. Monica Stephens

<h3>Course Requirements:</h3>




1. Access to a reliable high-speed internet connection
2. Knowledge of the Blackboard Learning Management System (UBLearns) 
3. A [UBIT account ](https://www.buffalo.edu/search/you)and password (necessary for logging into UB services)
4. A [UB ID card ](https://myubcard.com/card)(for access to the GIAL)
5. A USB-flash drive with 2GB available space
6. A [relatively new computer](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubit/service-guides/hardware/getting-started-with-hardware/purchasing-or-using-an-existing-computer.html) (a laptop is a plus) and the ability to install additional software
7. A working phone/tablet with a camera and GPS

Additional requirements and specific software are listed in the [Technology Requirements](#bookmark=id.eqj1jufyf9qw) section below.

There are no course prerequisite classes, but there are [technological competencies](http://ed.buffalo.edu/current-students/all-students/technology/prereq-skills.html) expected of students.  UBIT and the library offer [service guides](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubit/information-for-students.html) and workshops for many of the needed competencies. [Yujia Pan](#bookmark=id.c3iqek6l5eo2) can also assist students in gaining these competencies. 

<h3>Course Structure:</h3>




*   This 15-week course is divided into three modules: 
    *   I. Maps & The Internet
    *   II. How Maps Work
    *   III. Maps and Data.  
*   Each module includes a lab-based project with a workshop to guide you through the necessary steps, an exam, online “lectures” and readings with 5-6 quizzes, and 2-3 engagement activities. 
*   This is a live and synchronous class, so engagement activities and workshops require attendance at designated times/date.  While you demonstrate your knowledge online, each task has a deadline, once a deadline has passed, you can not make up the material.  

<h3>Assignments:</h3>




*   **Exams**--there are three exams in this course.  Exams are designed to demonstrate your understanding of content in the module and in previous modules (they are cumulative).  Exams are intended to be taken independently without study guides.  They  are delivered on UBLearns and they are are limited in the time they can be accessed. Exams can be taken at home, but help is available at designated times on campus.
*   **Projects**-There are three projects in this course. Each module concludes with a project that requires applying your knowledge and skills to develop a web-page portfolio.  There will be  workshops to help students advance through each project: 
    *   Project 1 (module I)-Building a website to house your portfolio for projects 2 and 3
    *   Project 2 (module II)-Orthorectifying a historic photo on Google Earth
    *   Project 3 (module III)-Making a choropleth and point map from a database

    If projects are submitted enough in advance of the deadline, they will be graded early which gives students the opportunity to fix errors and make changes and resubmit the project before the deadline.  However, projects submitted within 48 hours (2 days) of the deadline are unlikely to receive feedback until after the submission window has closed.  Projects submitted on time will be graded without penalty, but revisions will not result in a better project grade.  Project rubrics are available on UBLearns.

*   **Quizzes-** There are 17 quizzes in this course.  Each quiz directly responds to “lecture” material and/or readings are due before class begins on Tuesdays (3:30pm).  
*   **Engagement Activities**- There are eight engagement activities in this course.  These activities ask students to make a map with a pen and paper or work together in groups to play a game or demonstrate a concept.

    Projects, and exams are due at 5pm on the day indicated in the syllabus unless noted otherwise.  Quizzes are due at 3:30pm and the submission on UBLearns will close (making them unavailable).  Weekly content becomes available on Tuesdays.  


<h3>Course Assessment and Grading: </h3>


Your progress in this course is assessed on a 1000-point scale.  This allows you to decide what learning opportunities best fit your needs and strengths as a student. You can think of all assignments in this class as a menu, and you pick and choose which assignments opportunities you want to use to earn your grade.  

<p>Performance opportunities:



*   Projects: 3 projects, each can earn up to 100 points (300 total)
*   Exams: 3 exams, each can earn up to 70 points (210 total)
*   Engagement activities: 8 engagement activities, each can earn up to 40 points (320 total).
    *   Many engagement activities require class attendance and others are administered on UBLearns. 
*   Quizzes-there are 17 quizzes, each can earn up to 10 points (170)

You can monitor your progress towards the grade by using the “total points” column on the UBLearns gradebook.

If you are having a bad week and miss taking a quiz before the deadline, or have an emergency situation arise that prevents you from attending class and participating in the engagement activity, you have flexibility without impacting your grade.  You only receive points for the portions of class you choose to engage in.  So, for example, a student could achieve an A (minimum 840 points) even if they entirely miss 3 quizzes, miss two engagement activities/classes, and score poorly on one exam (35/70), but they wouldn’t be able to lose more than 5 points from another exam, project, engagement activity, or quiz without sacrificing the A-grade. There are no makeup opportunities, so plan ahead that you might have a situation arise where you are unable to earn credit.  

Keep working consistently to earn points through the semester as you can not go back and make up assignments that you missed. At the end of each module you can determine if you are on track for your choice grade:



*   Module 1: 350 points possible (6 quizzes, 3 engagements, 1 exam, 1 project) 
*   Module 2: 350 points possible (6 quizzes, 3 engagements, 1 exam, 1 project) 
*   Module 3: 300 points possible (5 quizzes, 2 engagements, 1 exam, 1 project)   

    If an extra credit opportunity presents (e.g. a relevant guest lecture on campus or an  extra assignment) the maximum possible points for the class may be above 1000.  Details about UB’s grading policies are in the [undergraduate course catalogue](https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/grading.html). Grades that are only 1 point away from the next level will not be “bumped up.”


<h3>Are you ready to learn online in a hybrid course?</h3>


Online learning is often described as “harder than expected.” This is due to the unique nature of online classes. If this is your first online class, please take a moment to click the link below and assess your readiness to succeed online. 



*   [https://innovate.suny.edu/assessment/quick-readiness-quiz/](https://innovate.suny.edu/assessment/quick-readiness-quiz/)

*   [https://innovate.suny.edu/assessment/essential-computer-skills-tutorial-and-assessment/](https://innovate.suny.edu/assessment/essential-computer-skills-tutorial-and-assessment/)

<h3>On Campus Requirements:</h3>




*   This is a hybrid course, so attendance on campus is mandatory on some days and optional on other dates.  You should attend every meeting on campus. I understand that extenuating circumstances arise that can make this difficult, and the grading structure allows you to select opportunities to miss.  However, If circumstances make you miss more than 3 engagement activities’ during the semester, you may have overextended yourself and you should consider resigning the class. 
*   The TA and the professor will not duplicate instruction and engagement activities from class time during office hours; nor will they provide technical support or additional help to students who do not attend class.
*   As this class is held in the Geographic Information Analysis Laboratory (aka the GIAL... pronounced like “Jail”), there are rules regarding conduct in [the GIAL](http://www.buffalo.edu/cas/geography/research/research_facilities/geography-gial.html): 
    *   [http://www.buffalo.edu/content/dam/cas/geography/documents/GIAL%20Policy.pdf](http://www.buffalo.edu/content/dam/cas/geography/documents/GIAL%20Policy.pdf)
*   This class does not lend itself well to incomplete grades.  Please speak to me during office hours if you have extenuating circumstances that prevent you from completing the course.  The University’s grading and incomplete policies are [here](https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/explanation.html).

<h3>Technology Requirements:</h3>




1. See [course materials](#bookmark=id.8ulmz6tcnjew) above for the computer requirements for this hybrid course.  Please note, a  laptop computer that you can bring to class with you is helpful (as you can start/finish work on your own machine at home), but GIAL computers are also available during in-class activities.
2. A USB drive with at least 2 GB of free space to save your files and move them between computers (no, you can not email them to yourself).  The bookstore carries these, and they are also [available online](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=usb+flash+drive&ref=nb_sb_noss_1) for under $5. 
3. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) (web browser).

6. Google Earth Pro (application).  Free download: [ https://www.google.com/earth/versions/](https://www.google.com/earth/versions/)

<h3>Reading Materials:</h3>

The high cost of texts is an ongoing issue for all students, and the socioeconomic diversity on campus is often invisible and overlooked.  Therefore, I have selected readings from a variety of open-source (free) and UB-library owned e-books, including:



*   Peterson, Michael P. (2014). <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mapping in the Cloud</span>. Guilford Press.  [Available as an e-book from the UB Library](https://search.lib.buffalo.edu/permalink/01SUNY_BUF/1l0ga0o/alma991058631867704801)

<h3>How to Access our course and get started:</h3>




*   Log into UBLearns:  [https://ublearns.buffalo.edu/](https://ublearns.buffalo.edu/)
*   Under “My Courses,” locate our course and click on it.
*   This will take you to the course home page. View the “Announcements & Schedule” on the homepage and proceed to the “Start Here” area (or click the links in the schedule).
*   Sign up for the [class Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/geo120/shared_invite/enQtOTE5NDkyMzIyOTY1LTIyZDRlN2M3MzM5NTU3NDRmM2E2YmE4MmE1NDNhY2MzMzM5YmM2MmZmMTZmNzQwYTNlMzFjMTdiY2FjNGVjOTg) and introduce yourself!

<h5>UBLearns</h5>

All students enrolled in this course have access to UBLearns (UB’s instance of Blackboard, often referred to as a LMS or CMS). Class material will be uploaded to UBLearns including “lectures”/videos,  readings, projects instructions, rubrics, and grades. All quizzes, projects, exams, and some engagement activities will be submitted through UBLearns.  

Learn more about [UBLearns here](http://www.buffalo.edu/ubit/service-guides/teaching-technology/learning-resources-for-students/ublearns.html).

<h5>Slack Channel</h5>


Slack is a communication platform that allows us to hold conversations, share files, images, and information. You can use it to ask for clarification on reading, ask for technical help, share a screenshot demonstrating your problem, have private messages with classmates, or even have a phone call with me.  Slack is intended a platform to support collaboration among teams in the workspace (and is very common at tech companies), I find it easier to use than any of the tools on UBLearns. Slack also has a great app for your smartphone that makes it easier to access class information on the go.  While we have a private channel for our class, Slack is not a secure communications medium, and should not be used for highly private and sensitive information (such as social security numbers, personal health information, or individual-specific grading information). 


*   To get started, [ sign up for our slack channel here](https://join.slack.com/t/geo120/shared_invite/enQtOTE5NDkyMzIyOTY1LTIyZDRlN2M3MzM5NTU3NDRmM2E2YmE4MmE1NDNhY2MzMzM5YmM2MmZmMTZmNzQwYTNlMzFjMTdiY2FjNGVjOTg) (use your @buffalo.edu email address).  
*   Once you’ve signed up,  then access the channel through the [https://geo120.slack.com/](https://geo120.slack.com/) link in your browser
*   You can download the Slack app on your phone and then add the geo120 workspace (use the same password/login email.

<h3>Course Policies:</h3>


<h5>Instructor Communication:</h5>


*   I am available to meet with you in person during my office hours, during class time, or in a group chat or private conversation [Slack](http://geo120.slack.com/). If you have a question or a concern that is not addressed in the syllabus, on UBLearns, or slack, please email me.  However, please recognize that lengthy, substantive and/or technical questions are best saved class or office hours and will not receive a response.  
*   If you are sending a professor an email, here are some [helpful guidelines](https://medium.com/@lportwoodstacer/how-to-email-your-professor-without-being-annoying-af-cf64ae0e4087).

<h5>UB Portfolio</h5>


*   If you are completing this course as part of your UB Curriculum requirements, please select an ‘artifact’ from this course that is representative of your learning and upload it to your UBPortfolio (powered by Digication) account.  Templates have been created for this purpose. Artifacts include homework assignments, exams, research papers, projects, lab reports, presentations, and other course materials. Your final UB Curriculum requirement, UBC 399: UB Curriculum Capstone, will require you to submit these ‘artifacts’ as you process and reflect on your achievement and growth through the UB Curriculum. For more information, see the UB Curriculum Capstone website: [https://www.buffalo.edu/ubcurriculum/capstone.html](https://www.buffalo.edu/ubcurriculum/capstone.html).

<h5>Late Work & Attendance </h5>

   *   Most assignments will be discussed in class on the due date, therefore late assignments will not receive credit.  It is expected that all work is submitted on time. The “due date” listed for a quiz is the time that the submission on UBLearns closes and the quiz becomes unavailable.  In a few cases (such as with  projects or some engagement activities), it is possible (although ill advised) to submit an assignment late.  In these cases, the score for the late assignment will be deductions of 1 point per hour the assignment is late.  These assignments will no longer be accepted once the maximum score is 0 (for example: a project that would earn 100 points, but is submitted 2 days or 48 hours  after the deadline, it would earn 52 points).  The menu of credit allows you to miss or earn a poor score on any assignment and earn credit on a different assignment.
    *   All quizzes and projects (and some engagements) are submitted on UBLearns and are time stamped upon submission.
    *   Equipment failure (or internet failure)  is not an acceptable reason for turning in an assignment late. You should always make a backup of your files (on your USB drive)  and upload your projects enough in advance of the deadline that you can bring the files and upload directly from the GIAL if necessary.  
    *   We do not take attendance, but students not participating in class will not have an opportunity to learn the material from the professor or teaching assistant, or make up missed credits.  If you miss a class, you should contact classmates for missed material. 
    *   There may be circumstances where you need to miss a class meeting, or are unavailable at the time a project is due.  You may need to travel with your sports team, attend an interview, court date, or doctors appointment.  You may have an emergency where you can’t focus on class. You do not need to inform the professor or TA of these absences. You can submit online material in advance of your absence, or pick a different path to your desired grade.

<h5>Take Care of yourself</h5>


*   Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.
*   All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
*   If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling Services  is here to help: call 716-645-2720 or visit the [Counseling Services - Student Life Gateway](https://www.buffalo.edu/studentlife/who-we-are/departments/counseling.html).  Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.

<h5>Cheating and academic dishonesty</h5>
 This course will adhere to the University at Buffalo’s [academic integrity policy](https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/academic_integrity_2019-20.html). Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:



*   Aiding in academic dishonesty. Knowingly taking action that allows another student to engage in an act of academic dishonesty including, but not limited to completing an examination or assignment for another student or stealing an examination or completed assignment for another student.
*   Cheating. Includes, but is not limited to: (1) use of any assistance not authorized by the course instructor in taking quizzes, tests, or examinations;  (3) stealing tests or other academic material belonging to the course instructor.
*   Falsifying academic materials or misrepresenting documents. Forgery, alteration, or misuse of any University or official document, record, or instrument of identification. Plagiarizing or copying material from any source and submitting that material as one’s own.
*   Purchasing academic assignments or Selling academic assignments
*   Submitting previously submitted work. Submitting academically required material that has been previously submitted, in whole or in substantial part, without prior and expressed consent of the instructor.

<h5>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h5>


*   Your experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Accessibility Resources (AR), please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through AR, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but are not limited to: mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact AR at  716-645-2608 to make an appointment. General information for students can be found on AR’s website: [https://www.buffalo.edu/studentlife/who-we-are/departments/accessibility.html](https://www.buffalo.edu/studentlife/who-we-are/departments/accessibility.html)

<h3>What I Expect of You:</h3>




*   Online and hybrid classes are deceiving. Many times new online learners expect them to be easier than face-to-face classes and are surprised to learn how time intensive they are.
*   Plan your schedule to ensure you have approximately 10 hours per week to spend on this class and take time to identify where and when you’ll do your learning.
*   Review the due dates for the quizzes, engagement activities, projects and exams (see Course Structure section) to orient yourself to the flow of the learning. This course requires regular engagement throughout each week.

<h3>Etiquette:</h3>

 In my classroom and online I support and want to foster a civil, respectful, and open-minded climate so that all of us can live and learn in an environment free of harassment, bias-motivated behaviors, unfair treatment, and fear. By committing to working with our better selves, we can work, in all our communities, towards greater mutual understanding of the questions that guide our inquiries. The university expects all members of our community to refrain from actions or behaviors that intimidate, humiliate,or demean persons or groups or that undermine their security or self-esteem based on traits related to race, ethnicity, country of origin, religion, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, age,or physical or mental ability, including learning and/or developmental disabilities and past/present history of mental disorder or other category protected by state or federal law.
